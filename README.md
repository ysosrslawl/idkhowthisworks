site is hosted on AWS at 3.20.40.46

I am trying to add a html form that will capture user submitted traffic data to a mysql database which I can then parse and visualize somehow.

Other future features include adding some kind of hosting for projects I have created or recording videos that I host on Youtube and then embed into the site.

Also, I should probably learn how to make this look more colorful. Never spent any real time with css other than this one basic project I did from a tutorial on YT.
Not sure where to put the styling code unless it goes in the style.css file of the main porject and will apply globally?
